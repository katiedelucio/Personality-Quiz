The goal of this project is to create a personality
quiz which will type users as either introverted or
extroverted based on their responses to a number of 
multiple choice questions. Users will then be given
an option to quit or play again. The project will 
be written using the Java programming language and
implement JavaFx to display the quiz questions. The program 
will contain three classes involving complex data structures 
using a graphical user interface. 
Tiffany Leister - Quiz Class
